## Predicting Student Success on the California ELPAC Summative Assessment

This project is a part of the ADS-599B course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

--Project Status:[Active]

## Installation:
To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

git init

git clone https://github.com/OscarG-DataSci/ADS-599B.git

Please note, the 1_Deidentify.ipynb script was used to produce the master file Deidentified/elpac.csv. This file is unnecessary to run after you clone the repository.

## Project Intro/Objective
The main purpose of this project is to identify data elements, assisting in the prediction of student success in the ELPAC Summative Assessment, for a school district in California.
We intend to create an application, for end users to enter data so that our machine learning model produces a predictive result.

## Project Description
The file used for this project, elpac.csv, was created from several different sources; they are:

Attendance information, comes from the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS), Student Attendance Summary (STAS) files, 
for five school years, 2017-2018, through 2021-2022.

Five years of ELPAC Assessment data was obtained from the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP).

Student demographic and Teacher information, was obtained from CALPADS reports 8.1 and 4.4.

Student and School data is de-identified, per request of the school district that gave us permission to use their data.
